# Incident-Report-3

In this activity, you will take on the role of a cybersecurity analyst working for a company that hosts the cooking website, yummyrecipesforme.com. Visitors to the website experience a security issue when loading the main webpage. Your job is to investigate, identify, document, and recommend a solution to the security problem. When investigating the security event, you will review a tcpdump log. You will need to identify the network protocols used to establish the connection between the user and the website. Network protocols are the communication rules and standards networked devices use to transmit data. Unfortunately, malicious actors can also use network protocols to invade and attack private networks.
# Scenario

 You are a cybersecurity analyst for yummyrecipesforme.com, a website that sells recipes and cookbooks. A former employee has decided to lure users to a fake website with malware. The baker executed a brute force attack to gain access to the web host. They repeatedly entered several known default passwords for the administrative account until they correctly guessed the right one. After they obtained the login credentials, they were able to access the admin panel and change the website’s source code. They embedded a javascript function in the source code that prompted visitors to download and run a file upon visiting the website. After embedding the malware, the baker changed the password to the administrative account. When customers download the file, they are redirected to a fake version of the website that contains the malware.Several hours after the attack, multiple customers emailed yummyrecipesforme’s helpdesk. They complained that the company’s website had prompted them to download a file to access free recipes. The customers claimed that, after running the file, the address of the website changed and their personal computers began running more slowly. In response to this incident, the website owner tries to log in to the admin panel but is unable to, so they reach out to the website hosting provider. You and other cybersecurity analysts are tasked with investigating this security event.
